# Blog of Lynn

I'm Lynn, a front-end engineer learned by myself after graduating from university. This is my online home & blog where I share thoughts about front-end development, my daily life and other insteresting topics. Now I'm living in Shanghai. If you are also in Shanghai, I'm very happy to make friends with you. Feel free to contact me by email if you have any question.
